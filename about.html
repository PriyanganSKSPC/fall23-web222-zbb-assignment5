        Hi, I am Priyangan Chandrathayan, a dedicated student from Sri Lanka, is currently pursuing
        a Computer Programming Analysis program at Seneca College. With a student ID of 159189224, I
        embarked on this educational journey in the summer of 2023 and is currently in the second
        semester of the program. Seneca College provides a dynamic and enriching environment for
        students like me to delve into the intricacies of computer programming, fostering a
        comprehensive understanding of the field. As I progresses through the program, the skills
        and knowledge gained will undoubtedly contribute to a successful and fulfilling career in
        the realm of computer programming.
